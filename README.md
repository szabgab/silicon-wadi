# Data

Companies are in the [companies.json](data/companies.json) file. 

Each company has an entry with one or more offices. See [skeleton.json](data/skeleton.json).

`technologies` should be a list of technologies used in the company. E.g. JavaScript, Python, Java, Docker, MySQL, AngularJS.
The list of technologies can be found in the [technologies.json](data/technologies.json) file. The list serves us a way to check we don't make typos and we don't have different spellings of the same thing. Update that file too if you'd like to include another technology.

https://www.gps-coordinates.net/ can be used to convert an `address` to `coordinates`.

`area` is one of the keys from the [areas.json](data/areas.json) file. We use this field to try to cluster the offices.
